# HWA-2-Tribe-of-Hackers-Discussion
In The Tribe of Hackers, Jennifer J. Gin and Marcus G. Garrey ask seventy great hackers to answer the most common questions regarding cyber security. Each hacker had something different to offer but the three that caught my attention the most were Claudio Guarnieri, Marina Krotofil, and Christina Morillo. 

Claudio Guarneri aka as “Nex” is an artist, free software developer, and a security researcher. At the moment he is the head of Security Lab at Amnesty International and is a member of The Honeynet Project. He created the malware analysis system Cuckoo Sandbox, Viper, and Hardentools. In past years, he has shifted his focus onto issues of privacy and surveillance. He has published many articles regarding such issues onto different surveillance vendors such as NSO group, FinFisher, and HackingTeam with the Citizen Lab. As an artist, he enjoys working with traditional media along with new and generative art. Some of his work has gotten so far to be exhibited and published in Berlín, London, and Las Vegas. 

Marina Krotofil is a Senior Security Consultant at the European Network for Cyber Security. She attended Hamburg University of Technology and studied for her PhD in ICS security. During her time in ICS security she learned many skills such as discovering and weaponizing unique attack vectors and learning how to engineer damage scenarios. She has published many papers relating cyber physical exploitation and she often speaks at leading ICS security conferences around the world. 

Christina Morillo is an information security enterprise identity, practitioner, and technical product manager. She has a Bachelor's degree in information technology from American Intercontinental University-Online and is currently working on her masters in Cybersecurity at Georgia Institute of Technology. She also has experience relating to enterprise security and identity, insider threat, cloud identity, and programs and deployment. Along with that she has several certifications one of them being a Cybersecurity and Privacy Law Certificate from Mitchell Hamline School of Law. For Morillo it is really important that she not only meets companies and people where they are but that she also makes security practical, accessible, and easy to digest. She is very passionate about creating and connecting opportunities for others and empowering women and people of color to follow careers in technology and security. Currently, she is working at Marqeta as a Sr. Security Product Manager. If she is not at work she is either working on her upcoming book collaboration “97 Things Every Infospec Pro Should Know” or co-leading Women in Security and Privacy’s NYC Chapter. 

Out of the three I really focused on Christina Morillo because not only is she a woman in a male dominated industry but she is also a first generation immigrant. It is really inspiring to see how she stands her ground and doesn’t let anyone discourage her from what she is meant to do. I think she sends a good message to younger generations and people who are often underrepresented because she is proof that anyone no matter where they come from can be successful within this industry. Although there will be challenges at some point like she said you'll be confident within yourself that you will be unbothered by their doubt.
